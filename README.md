## Objectives

Develop a database to manage the results of the Portuguese handball championship's first division. This database should handle the recording of matchday results, goal scorers, home and away teams. Its purpose is to provide an up-to-date overview of the championship standings on any given day, identifying teams eligible for European competitions as well as those at risk of relegation
